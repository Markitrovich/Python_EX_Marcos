README for Python Exercises Marcos Dumortier

Overview

Branches

Branch 1: Contains Python_Ex1.ipynb with basic Python exercises.
Branch 2: Contains Python_Ex2.ipynb with more advanced exercises.
Branch 3: Contains Python_Ex3.ipynb, covering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 

This repository contains Marcos' Python_Ex1.ipynb, Python_Ex2.ipynb and Python_Ex3.ipynb which include exercises for practicing Python programming concepts.
All questions are present in the files.

Usage
For Python_Ex1 & 2: Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to see the results. 
For Python_Ex3:

Ensure you have the Jupyter and Python extensions installed in Visual Studio Code.
Open .ipynb files directly in VS Code by selecting "Open with..." > "Jupyter Notebook".
You can run each cell interactively and view outputs in the notebook interface.

1. Greeting Message: Printing a simple message.
2. Arithmetic Operations: Basic math with variables.
3. Personalized Greeting: Using a variable for dynamic output.
4. Lists: Creating and accessing elements in a list.
5. Dictionaries: Key-value pairs and printing them.
6. Tuples: Storing fixed collections of items.
7. Sets: Unique collections of items and operations on sets.
8. User Input: Taking input and conditionally checking values.
9. For Loops: Iterating through a list of numbers.
10. While Loops: Looping with a termination condition.
11. Match Statement: Handling multiple conditions with user input.
12. Functions: Creating and using functions for reusable code.
13. List Comprehension: Simplifying list creation.

16. Grade Average: Calculating average grades from a dictionary.
17. Custom Calculator Function: Implementing a function to perform mathematical operations based on user input.

Python_Ex2.ipynb Topics

1. FizzBuzz Function: Implementing the FizzBuzz logic to print different outputs based on the number's divisibility.
2. Basic Data Filtering:
    * Creating a mixed list of data types.
    * Filtering to keep only integers using list comprehension.
3. Task Management:
    * Creating an empty list for tasks.
    * Defining functions to add and show tasks.
4. Temperature Conversion:
    * Defining a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
    * Printing results for various temperatures.

Python_Ex3.ipynb Topics

This notebook focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

First part: theory & examples 

Second part: Hands On exercises

Exercise 1: Course Class
Manages course details and enrolled students with methods to add, remove, and display students.
Exercise 2: Student Class
Manages student information and enrolled courses with methods to enroll, drop, and display courses.
Exercise 3: Registrar Class
Manages the entire registration system, linking students to courses. Key methods include adding students/courses, enrolling students in courses, dropping courses, and displaying all students and courses.
Exercise 4: Adding Grades and GPA Calculation
Extends functionality by tracking grades and calculating GPAs, with new methods for assigning grades and calculating a studentâ€™s GPA.
