*Overview*

This repository contains Marcos' exercises for practicing Python programming concepts.
All questions are present in the files.

**Branches**

Branch 1: Contains Python_Ex1.ipynb with basic Python exercises.

Branch 2: Contains Python_Ex2.ipynb with more advanced exercises.

Branch 3: Contains Python_Ex3.ipynb, covering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Branch 4: Contains Python_Ex4.ipynb, focusing on File Handling and Data Processing in Python.

Branch 5: Annotation Processing and Analysis, including metadata extraction, annotation grouping, and filtering tasks.

Branch 6: Matplotlib exercises, focusing on bar charts and annotations.

Branch 7: Seaborn exercises, including lineplots, histograms, ECDF plots, and advanced categorical plots.

Branch 8: Combined Matplotlib and Seaborn exercises, emphasizing customization and real-world visualization tasks.


**Usage**

For Python_Ex1 & 2: Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to see the results. 

For Python_Ex3 & 4:
Ensure you have the Jupyter and Python extensions installed in Visual Studio Code.
Open .ipynb files directly in VS Code by selecting "Open with..." > "Jupyter Notebook".
You can run each cell interactively and view outputs in the notebook interface.
Kernel used to do the exercises: Python environmnent: Python 3.12.2

For Python_EX5: update annotations_folder with your directory path before running the notebook.

For Sessions 6, 7, and 8, install required libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, pandas) if not already available:

pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
