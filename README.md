README for Python Exercises Marcos Dumortier

*Overview*

**Branches**

Branch 4: Contains Python_Ex4.ipynb, focusing on File Handling and Data Processing in Python.

This repository contains Marcos' exercises for practicing Python programming concepts. All questions are present in the files.

For Python_Ex3 & 4: Ensure you have the Jupyter and Python extensions installed in Visual Studio Code. Open .ipynb files directly in VS Code by selecting "Open with..." > "Jupyter Notebook". You can run each cell interactively and view outputs in the notebook interface. Kernel used to do the exercises: Python environmnent: Python 3.12.2

**Python_Ex4 Topics**

This notebook focuses on File Handling and Data Processing using Python, with exercises centered around working with annotation files in a specified format.

Structure First Part: Overview of file handling, data extraction, and sorting techniques. Second Part: Hands-On Exercises for processing annotation data.

Exercises Exercise 1: Counting Files Determines the total number of files in the annotation folder.

Exercise 2: Validating Filename Conventions Checks how many files adhere to a specified naming convention for annotations, ensuring data consistency.

Exercise 3: Monthly and Yearly Annotation Counts Counts annotations per month and year, identifying the month with the highest number of annotations.

Exercise 4: Organizing Annotations by Month Creates a new folder structure with subfolders organized by month, then moves or copies files into the respective folders.

Exercise 5: Sorting Files by Date and Time Sorts all annotations from the most recent to the oldest based on date and time extracted from filenames.

Exercise 6: Satellite Analysis Analyzes satellite data by: Counting unique satellites. Identifying the satellite associated with the most recent annotation. Calculating the number of annotations per satellite.

Exercise 7: Unique Region Count Counts the unique regions based on the filename convention, providing insight into the diversity of regions covered in the annotations.

Extra excercise: Numpy: Demonstrates numpy usage for counting unique satellites.
