1. Line Plot:
   
Create a line plot showing how Study Time varies by Student Name.
Identify the student with the highest study time.

3. Histogram:
   
Plot a histogram (histplot) of Grade.
Determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.

5. ECDF Plot:
   
Create an ECDF plot (ecdfplot) for Grade.
Calculate the percentage of students scoring less than 85.

7. Strip Plot:
   
Show the grade distribution for each course using a stripplot.
Determine which course has the most spread in grades.

9. Swarm Plot:
    
Use a swarmplot to show the relationship between Gender and Study Time.
Identify which gender has a higher average study time.

10. Point Plot:

Create a pointplot to display the average Grade for each course.
Identify the course with the highest average grade.
