**Usage**
For Python_Ex1 & 2: Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to see the results. 

For Python_Ex3 & 4:
Ensure you have the Jupyter and Python extensions installed in Visual Studio Code.
Open .ipynb files directly in VS Code by selecting "Open with..." > "Jupyter Notebook".
You can run each cell interactively and view outputs in the notebook interface.
Kernel used to do the exercises: Python environmnent: Python 3.12.2

**Python_Ex3.ipynb Topics**

This notebook focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

First part: theory & examples 

Second part: Hands On exercises

Exercise 1: Course Class
Manages course details and enrolled students with methods to add, remove, and display students.
Exercise 2: Student Class
Manages student information and enrolled courses with methods to enroll, drop, and display courses.
Exercise 3: Registrar Class
Manages the entire registration system, linking students to courses. Key methods include adding students/courses, enrolling students in courses, dropping courses, and displaying all students and courses.
Exercise 4: Adding Grades and GPA Calculation
Extends functionality by tracking grades and calculating GPAs, with new methods for assigning grades and calculating a studentâ€™s GPA.

**Python_Ex4.ipynb Topics**

This notebook focuses on File Handling and Data Processing using Python, with exercises centered around working with annotation files in a specified format.

Structure
First Part: Overview of file handling, data extraction, and sorting techniques.
Second Part: Hands-On Exercises for processing annotation data.

Exercises
Exercise 1: Counting Files
Determines the total number of files in the annotation folder.

Exercise 2: Validating Filename Conventions
Checks how many files adhere to a specified naming convention for annotations, ensuring data consistency.

Exercise 3: Monthly and Yearly Annotation Counts
Counts annotations per month and year, identifying the month with the highest number of annotations.

Exercise 4: Organizing Annotations by Month
Creates a new folder structure with subfolders organized by month, then moves or copies files into the respective folders.

Exercise 5: Sorting Files by Date and Time
Sorts all annotations from the most recent to the oldest based on date and time extracted from filenames.

Exercise 6: Satellite Analysis
Analyzes satellite data by:
Counting unique satellites.
Identifying the satellite associated with the most recent annotation.
Calculating the number of annotations per satellite.

Exercise 7: Unique Region Count
Counts the unique regions based on the filename convention, providing insight into the diversity of regions covered in the annotations.

Extra excercise: Numpy:
Demonstrates numpy usage for counting unique satellites.
